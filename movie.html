    <h1>stroy of asta</h1>
    <p>Asta is first seen in Black Clover as a baby left at Hage church with Yuno. 
        He was born without any magic in the Clover Kingdom, where all its citizens are mages. 
        Despite this disability, he aspires to become the Wizard King to end the discrimination within the country. 
        After saving Yuno from a thief as children, the two boys make a promise to become rivals in becoming the Wizard King. 
        At the annual grimoire ceremony for fifteen-year olds in the kingdom, Asta is not chosen by a grimoire. 
        When Yuno is attacked by the thief Revchi for his four-leaf clover grimoire, Asta tries to stop Revchi but is beaten and learns that he has no magic at all. 
        Nearly despairing, Yuno's acknowledgement of Asta as his rival gives him the motivation to keep fighting. 
        He is then chosen by a five-leaf grimoire, from which he can wield a giant sword with the power of anti-magic. 
        Asta defeats Revchi and reaffirms his promise to compete with Yuno to become the Wizard King. 
        At the magic knight selection exam, Asta earns the respect of Yami Sukehiro and is recruited into the Black Bulls, the worst magic knights squad, with fellow newcomer Noelle Silva.</p>
